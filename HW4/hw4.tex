		\item Proof by Contradiction: Assume $L$ is regular, then\\ $\exists m\in \Naturals,\forall x\in L$, $|x|>m, \exists a, b, c \in w^*, x=abc, |ab|\leq m, |b|>0,\\ \forall k\in\Naturals, ab^{k}c\in L$.
		Consider $ww$ and denote each substring $w$ as $w_1$ and $w_2$. Then, decompose it in any possible way into $abc$ satisfying $|ab|\leq m$,	$|b|>0$. Then, set $k=0$ for any $b$ that was chosen. Three cases can arise: 
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item b is entirely in $w_1$
			\item b is entirely in $w_2$
			\item b is partially in $w_1$ and $w_2$
		\end{enumerate}
		The first two cases are trivial because under pumping $b^0$ will make either $w_1$ or $w_2$ no longer equal to the original $w$. If the thrid cases arises, then both $w_1$ and $w_2$ will both not be equal to the $w$. In all three cases, a contradiction has occured.
		\item Proof by Contradiction: Assume $L$ is regular. 
		Then, using the Closure property of Homomorphism, we can say $L^{'}=\{w\in \{0,1\}^*:|w|_0\neq|w|_1\}$ is obtained from the homomorphism $a\ra0$ and $b\ra1$. 
		Then, using the Closure property of Complementation, we say\\ $L^{''}=\{w\in \{0,1\}^*:|w|_0=|w|_1\}$. 
		Then, using the Closure property of Concatenation, we say $L^{''}(M_1)*L^{''}(M_2)=L^{'''}=\{w\in \{0,1\}^*: ww\}$. However, note that $L^{'''}$ is regular, but using the proof from problem one, $L^{'''}$ is nonregular, a contradiction.
